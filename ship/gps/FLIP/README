		Differential GPS Data Recorded During SWelleEX-96
		=================================================

System

GPS System: Magellan GPS NAV 500 DLX
Sampling Rate: Approximately 1 record every 1 to 5 seconds
Differential Radio Station: 170.175 MHz

Antenna Setup

The Differential Station used was that broadcasting from North Island
transmitting at 170.175 MHz. An outdoor antenna was used with the VHS
receiver to ensure differential signal reception at all times. The
GPS antenna was attached to the starboard rails on the upper (penthouse)
deck on FLIP. Its altitude was about 6 feet above the deck's floor, which is
approximately 60 feet above water level.

Recording System

Zenith XT Laptop, running a Procomm-Plus script to create data files 
every approximately 2 hours (500 Kbytes in size). Due to disk space 
limitations in the Zenith Laptop, data files were transferred periodically 
to a Sun Microsystems workstation for storage and further processing.

The Data

A total of 375,583 dgps points were recorded during the experiment. Data
were recorded starting on 05/08/96 16:52 Z and finishing on 05/19/95
15:00 Z. There were a few minor interruptions in the beginning of the
data recording to allow for changes in the recording system (from a 486
PC to the Zenith Laptop). In addition, DGPS positioning had drop-outs
every now and then, so at those instances non-differential positioning
was recorded (regular GPS). Non-differential GPS information were not 
considered in the processing of these data. The data were stored in 120
ASCII files.

The average FLIP position was:

 32 deg 40.250' N
117 deg 21.635' W

Variance (of Minutes of a Degree):

Latitude --> 0.24485E-05 (std = 0.15648E-02)
Longitud --> 0.77125E-05 (std = 0.27771E-02)
